# led-neuron-firing-model
LED neuron firing model developed for arduino as a part of the Brandeis Art Science Initiative

C. Caggiano and R. Boros worked extensively on creating a light display
using LEDs and arduinos, in order to mimic the natural propagation of
a neuron firing - essentially what the BZ reaction models. We are extremely grateful
for the help of the MakerLab in this component.

The code for the LED firing model is available on Github [here](https://github.com/christacaggiano/led-neuron-firing-model)
